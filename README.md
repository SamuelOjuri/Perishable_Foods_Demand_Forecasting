# Perishable Foods Demand Forecasting

An Intelligent Decision Support System for Retail Management

Given the limited shelf life of perishable foods, it can be a real challenge for retailers to stock them
effectively. The continuous rapidly diminishing value of the products over time results in the short shelf life of products.
Accurate demand forecasting is critical to managing inventory efficiently and ensuring the timely distribution of
food products. Poor forecasting can result in overstocking, which can lead to waste and financial losses,
or understocking, which can lead to customer dissatisfaction and lost sales. 
Retailers are faced with the dilemma of a smart inventory management system to curtail wastage and
losses in sales. This necessitates an intelligent decision support system that can accurately predict
demand for products so that retailers can order the right quantities of raw materials for efficient
inventory management. In this study, machine learning models are used to estimate demand
for perishable commodities. The performance of a variety of regression models on a dataset
for a meal delivery company ia evaluated. Results from the study show that the gradient-boosting model performs
better than other models considered. We also discuss the benefits and limitations of the models used
to forecast demand in this case study.
